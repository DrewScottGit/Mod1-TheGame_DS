How to play:
- The game is played by the user selecting their icon (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). Once they click their icon the computer will randomly select a move from the three mentioed above. Wins and losses are tracked and the game will last as long as the user wants to play.

Technologies used:
- I used HTML for the structure of the document
- I used CSS to style the bulk of the document
- I used JS to build the functions that manipulate the data

- The HTML is simple and consise to setup the document. 
- The CSS that was used was set up in a way that the game can be played on a mobile deivce, a tablet, and a desktop. Each visual iteration of the game adjust to the screen size and has full playability. 
- The JS utilizes functions and loops to maniuplate the data. Each icon choice that the user plays triggers the comupter to loop through a random choice function. The results of this function are then compared amongst a list of If statements that determine the winner and loser of the icons selected.
